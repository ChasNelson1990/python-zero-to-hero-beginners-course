    "- Python lists, \n",
    "- NumPy arrays, \n",
    "- Pandas dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python `list` is a data type (remember our other data types). Unlike, for example, `int`, the `list` data type is able to store many different values in one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `list` is 'contained' within square brackets (`[...]`) and each element within the list is separated by a comma (`,`)."

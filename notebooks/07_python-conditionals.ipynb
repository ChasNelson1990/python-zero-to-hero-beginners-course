    "## Conditionals and `if` statements\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming a 'conditional' gives code the ability to make a choice - usually a yes/no choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common conditional is the `if` statement, which takes the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if <BooleanExpression>:\n",
    "    print('Do something in this special situation.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Like a `for` loop, there are two special features of `if` statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `if` statements must end in a colon, this signals the start of the code you want to run in that situation.\n",
    "2. The body of an `if` statement (called a branch) must be indented,. Thankfully, Jupyter should autoindent lines following a colon for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boolean expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about our `<BooleanExpression>` (above).\n",
    "\n",
    "A Boolean expression is any expression that can be evaluated as true or false, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $1=1$ is true\n",
    "* $1=2$ is false\n",
    "* $1<2$ is true\n",
    "* $4\\ge5$ is false"

    "The remaining three notebooks will introduce key modules that you're likely to use in the future. We will talk through these during the course but you will do the exercises after the course.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you're attending the face-to-face training, Tasks (in light blue) will be completed during the course with Exercises (in light orange) for completing outside the course and building up your skills.\n",

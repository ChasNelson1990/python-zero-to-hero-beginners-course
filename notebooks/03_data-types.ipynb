    "\n",
    "For example, Python (and hopefully you) thinks that it's perfectly okay to multiply two numbers together but not two words!\n",

    "Python has a large number of types but for now we will consider only three:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `int` or integers (whole numbers)\n",
    "* `float` or floats (numbers with decimal information)\n",
    "* `str` or character strings, i.e. text\n",
    "  * Note that strings are always delimited by `'` or `\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also has a built-in function that will tell you what type some data is."

    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs can easily become large and unweilding. Functions enable us to break programs down into smaller chunks, making our code easier to understand *and* easier to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "A further benefit of functions is that they can be reused - it's the 'write once, use often' philosophy of coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already called several built-in functions, which might seem a little bit like black boxes but below we will define our own functions and control their internal workings ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining Functions with `def`\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining our own functions in Python uses a `def` statement and takes the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    print('My custom function has been called.')\n",
    "    return\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five important features of `def` statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our definition starts with `def`.\n",
    "2. This is followed by a name for our custom function. Function names follow the same rules as variable names.\n",
    "3. After the variable name we need a pair of parentheses (we will come back to these below).\n",
    "4. `def` statements must end in a colon, this signals the start of the code you want to run when your custom function is called.\n",
    "5. The body of a `def` statement must be indented. Thankfully, Jupyter should autoindent lines following a colon for you.\n",
    "6. The final line of a function must `return` something (refer back to Returns in Built-in Functions, Help and Documentation above). If nothing is provided (as here) then the function returns `None`."

    "## Functions and Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the built-in functions we've used so far have input parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are defined by putting the name of a parameter between the parentheses of our `def` statement. In fact, we can include several parameters, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def print_date(year, month, day):\n",
    "    print(f\"The ISO format date is {year}-{month:02}-{day:02}\")\n",
    "    return\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "N.B. The formatting `{0:02}` means 'format (`:`) the first parameter (`0`) with leading zeros (`0`) to a width of two digits (`2`), e.g. `f\"{9:02}\"` will print `09`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "We can even make optional parameters. Or, more precisely, we can give parameters default values. These default values can be used if the parameter is not used when the function is called."
